My Experience with Urban Gardening

I started gardening on my tiny apartment balcony about three years ago, mostly because I was bored during lockdown. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing at first. My first tomato plant died within two weeks - I overwatered it like crazy.

What I Learned the Hard Way

So here's the thing about growing vegetables in containers: drainage matters way more than I expected. I killed probably 6 or 7 plants before I figured out that those little holes at the bottom of pots aren't optional. Who knew, right?

The summer of 2022 was brutal. We hit 38°C for like, a whole week straight. Lost most of my lettuce (it bolted immediately) and the basil just gave up. But weirdly enough, my peppers loved it? They produced about 2.3 kg of jalapeños, which was honestly more than I could handle.

Some Numbers That Surprised Me

I kept track of everything because I'm kind of obsessive that way. In my 4.5 square meter balcony space, I managed to grow:
- 47 tomatoes (various sizes, not all good)
- Around 2 kg of herbs
- 12 cucumbers (the small pickling kind)
- Way too many zucchinis

The zucchini thing was a mistake. Three plants produced so much that I was basically forcing squash on my neighbors by August. One colleague told me she'd started hiding when she saw me coming with another bag.

What Actually Works

After a lot of trial and error - okay, mostly error - I've figured out a few things. Morning watering works better than evening, at least in my setup. The cheap potting soil from the dollar store is garbage; spend the extra money. And those "self-watering" containers? Total game changer when I went on vacation for 10 days.

I'm not saying I'm an expert now. Last month I somehow killed a supposedly "unkillable" succulent. But I'm getting better, I think. This year's tomato harvest was actually edible, which feels like progress.
