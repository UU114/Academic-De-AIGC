Turning Waste into Soil Wealth: Synergistic Mechanisms, Circular Economy Benefits, and Environmental Trade-offs of Integrated Amendments for Saline-Alkali Soil Reclamation
Abstract
The concurrent escalation of global soil salinization and solid waste generation poses a dual threat to food security and ecosystem stability. While "waste-to-wealth" strategies offer a circular pathway for remediation, a systemic understanding of the interfacial cascading mechanisms and life-cycle trade-offs within integrated amendment systems remains fragmented. This review critically synthesizes the valorization of industrial by-products (e.g., FGD gypsum) and agricultural residues (e.g., biochar) into functional soil conditioners. We elucidate the "interfacial synergies" where organic scaffolds construct a "Structure-Leaching" nexus to accelerate chemical displacement, while simultaneously reactivating the "Microbial Carbon Pump" for stable carbon sequestration. Evidence from global meta-analyses and long-term field trials demonstrates that integrated amendments significantly outperform single-factor treatments, reducing soil electrical conductivity (EC) by 23.6% and boosting crop yield by 36.5%. Crucially, optimized low-carbon strategies can increase Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks by over 60%, with Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) revealing net negative carbon footprints (e.g., −395.1 kg $CO_2$-eq/t) for specific biochar pathways. However, trade-offs regarding heavy metal accumulation from industrial sources necessitate rigorous risk-based "End-of-Waste" criteria. Ultimately, we propose a paradigm shift from empirical "trial-and-error" to AI-driven precision remediation, establishing integrated waste valorization as a pivotal component of Cleaner Production for sustainable saline-alkali soil management.

1 Introduction
1.1 The Dual Challenge: Saline-Alkaline Land and Waste Accumulation
Global food security is currently facing the unprecedented pressure of feeding a projected 9.7 billion people by 2050, yet the pedosphere—the very foundation of agriculture—is rapidly deteriorating. Soil salinization and sodification have emerged as primary drivers of land degradation, affecting over 1 billion hectares globally, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. This "Edaphic Cancer" not only compromises crop productivity but also disrupts essential ecosystem services, threatening the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically Zero Hunger (SDG 2) and Life on Land (SDG 15). Parallel to this soil crisis is the accelerating generation of solid wastes. The intensification of industrial and agricultural activities produces billions of tons of by-products annually—ranging from Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) gypsum in the energy sector to crop straw and livestock manure in agro-systems. Conventionally, these residues are treated as environmental liabilities, often disposed of in landfills or via open burning, which contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and secondary pollution. This linear "take-make-waste" model contradicts the principles of Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12), creating an urgent need to decouple agricultural development from environmental degradation.
1.2 Limitations of Linear Remediation vs. Circular Valorization
Traditional strategies for reclaiming saline-alkali soils have predominantly relied on hydraulic engineering (e.g., leaching) or the application of mined chemical amendments (e.g., natural gypsum). While effective, these linear approaches are increasingly constrained by freshwater scarcity and the high economic and ecological costs of extracting non-renewable mineral resources. Furthermore, single-factor amendments often fail to address the complex, coupled constraints of saline-sodic soils—such as simultaneous structural degradation, nutrient deficiency, and microbial dormancy. In this context, the concept of "Waste-to-Wealth" offers a transformative solution. A paradigm shift is occurring towards integrated amendments—the synergistic coupling of industrial by-products (as calcium sources) and agricultural residues (as carbon scaffolds). This circular approach posits that "treating waste with waste" can generate emergent properties: for instance, acidic industrial wastes can neutralize soil alkalinity, while organic residues buffer the osmotic stress and reactivate the soil microbiome. This integration aims to create a closed-loop system where waste streams from one sector become value-added inputs for another, maximizing resource efficiency.
1.3 Gap Statement & Objectives
Despite extensive investigation into individual remediation materials, a systemic understanding of the interfacial cascading mechanisms and life-cycle environmental trade-offs within integrated, waste-derived systems remains fragmented. Current literature often focuses on short-term yield gains, overlooking the long-term stability of sequestered carbon and the potential risks of heavy metal accumulation from industrial sources. Consequently, this review critically evaluates the valorization of industrial and agricultural by-products into functional soil amendments, prioritizing evidence from long-term field trials and multi-criteria assessments to ensure agronomic and ecological validity. By synthesizing the nexus of physicochemical restructuring, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, this work establishes a hierarchical framework for sustainable saline-alkali soil management that aligns agricultural productivity with the principles of circular economy and cleaner production.

2 Typology: Valorization of Wastes into Functional Amendments
2.1 Industrial By-products: From Pollutants to Calcium/Acid Donors
Industrial residues, traditionally stockpiled in landfills where they pose leaching and dust generation risks, are being re-evaluated in saline-alkali land remediation as valuable "chemical antidotes". Rich in calcium ($Ca^{2+}$) and sulfur (S), these materials provide essential ions to displace sodium ($Na^+$) from soil colloids and neutralize alkalinity, effectively transforming an environmental burden into a restoration asset.
Prominent among these is Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) gypsum, a byproduct of coal-fired power plants. Utilizing FGD gypsum represents a circular flow of sulfur from the energy sector to agriculture, distinguishing it from extractive natural gypsum mining. Its primary remediation function involves the rapid release of $Ca^{2+}$ to replace exchangeable $Na^+$ on clay particles, which facilitates leaching and improves flocculation. Empirical support for this approach is robust; Zhao et al. (2018) conducted a large-scale reclamation study (1780 ha) on the Songnen Plain, demonstrating that FGD gypsum significantly reduced soil pH, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), and electrical conductivity (EC) over three years, while heavy metal concentrations in harvested rice remained well below safety limits. Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Wang et al. (2021) confirmed its broad applicability across diverse climatic zones, showing consistent improvements in physicochemical properties and crop productivity.
Similarly, Phosphogypsum (PG), a solid waste generated during phosphoric acid production, offers significant potential due to its massive accumulation—approximately 5 tons are generated for every ton of acid produced. Due to its residual acidity, PG serves as a potent acid donor that neutralizes alkaline salts (carbonates) in sodic soils while simultaneously supplying calcium. Smaoui-Jardak et al. (2017) highlighted that PG significantly reduced soil EC and improved tomato growth. However, this material presents a critical trade-off: application rates exceeding 20% have been linked to substantial increases in soil Cadmium (Cd) levels (up to 92.5%), emphasizing the necessity for strict dosage control.
Distinct from chemical conditioners, Fly Ash and Slag function largely as physical conditioners. Fly ash, the fine residue captured from flue gases, is characterized by a porous, microsphere structure that modifies soil texture. This modification reduces bulk density and breaks up compacted layers to enhance permeability, contrasting with the chemical action of gypsum. An et al. (2024) reported that fly ash-based amendments significantly decreased bulk density from 1.49 to 1.36 g·cm⁻³ and increased total porosity by 15.6%, thereby creating a favorable environment for root growth.
2.2 Agricultural Residues: Carbon Scaffolds for Structure & Microbiome
While agricultural residues have historically been sources of pollution through open burning, in saline-alkali reclamation they serve as critical "carbon scaffolds," replenishing depleted Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) and reconstructing soil architecture.
Biochar, produced via the pyrolysis of biomass, locks unstable carbon into a stable, aromatic form suitable for long-term sequestration. Its porous structure acts as a physical skeleton, increasing hydraulic conductivity to facilitate salt leaching, while its abundant surface functional groups provide adsorption sites for $Na^+$, reducing osmotic stress. Recent advancements include the valorization of specific waste streams; Deng et al. (2023) highlighted Herbal Medicine Residue (TCMR) as a novel feedstock. Their Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) revealed that converting TCMR into biochar achieved a carbon-negative process (net GHG: -395.1 kg $CO_2$-eq/t), exemplifying a high-value pathway for pharmaceutical waste. The efficacy of such organic amendments is well-supported: a meta-analysis by Li et al. (2025) cite_start confirmed that organic inputs reduced soil EC by 23.6% and ESP by 43.4%, while increasing crop yield by 36.5%.
Complementing biochar are Compost and Vermicompost, derived from the aerobic fermentation of manure and straw. Unlike the recalcitrant nature of biochar, these materials provide "active" organic matter, serving as a "starter" for the microbiome by introducing beneficial microbes and labile carbon to activate nutrient cycling. Vermicompost is particularly noted for improving aggregate stability through microbial secretions. Hemdan & Zou (2024) demonstrated a synergistic effect when co-applying rice straw compost (4 tons/fed) with mineral sulfur (400 kg/fed); sulfur oxidation neutralized alkalinity while compost improved hydro-physical properties, significantly enhancing sorghum yields compared to single treatments.
2.3 Emerging Bio-based Materials & Functional Composites
The frontier of remediation is shifting from "direct application" to "Engineered Amendments," where waste streams are upgraded through targeted modifications. One such innovation is Sediment Valorization, where Fish Pond Sediment (FPS) is redefined from a eutrophication risk to a raw material for "Topsoil Construction" in coastal lands. Luo et al. (2024) utilized Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) to evaluate this strategy, finding that applying 80% FPS generated a peak ecological benefit of 274,951 CNY ha⁻¹, driven by SOM accumulation and nutrient cycling. Similarly, Sewage Sludge (Biosolids) serves as a persistent nutrient reservoir. Tai et al. (2016) showed that soils amended with sludge 35 years prior retained significantly higher nutrient reserves, suggesting a permanent alteration of fertility trajectories, although heavy metal risks remain a concern.
Engineered composites represent the pinnacle of precision remediation. To counteract native biochar alkalinity, Guan et al. (2024) demonstrated that Acidified Biochar successfully neutralized soil pH and improved hydraulic properties over a 3-year trial, effectively resolving the "biochar-induced alkalization" paradox. On the physical front, Xie et al. (2025) revealed that ball-milled Nano-Biochar (NB), co-applied with straw, exhibited superior performance by promoting the formation of aromatic-rich SOC networks and accelerating stable carbon accumulation.

3 Mechanistic Synergies at the Interfaces
Current research suggests that the efficacy of integrated amendments stems from "interfacial synergies" where physical, chemical, and biological processes catalyze each other. This section deconstructs these cascading mechanisms into three coupled dimensions.

3.1 Physical-Chemical Coupling: The "Structure-Leaching" Nexus
The fundamental synergy in saline-sodic soil reclamation lies in the coupling of physical restructuring and chemical displacement. In solitary applications, chemical amendments like FGD gypsum often suffer from low efficiency in heavy-textured soils due to hydraulic restrictions that prevent displaced $Na^+$ from leaching out of the root zone. Integrated amendments overcome this by establishing a "Structure-Leaching" nexus that synchronizes the release of $Ca^{2+}$ with the creation of hydraulic pathways. Organic scaffolds, particularly biochar and superabsorbent polymers, construct a "macropore network" that breaks the hydraulic barrier. Zhang et al. (2025) demonstrated that the co-application of superabsorbent carbon-based materials and FGD gypsum created a synergistic effect, increasing $Na^+$ leaching by 90.92% compared to the control. This was attributed to the carbon material's high specific surface area enhancing soil porosity and water retention, which facilitated gypsum dissolution and subsequent $Na^+$ transport. Similarly, Liang et al. (2021) identified an optimal biochar threshold (~21.9 t ha⁻¹) that maximizes saturated hydraulic conductivity ($K_s$), preventing "resalination" by ensuring displaced $Na^+$ is effectively flushed into deeper soil profiles.
Beyond physical structure, this coupling influences pH neutralization kinetics. Wang et al. (2023) revealed that while FGD gypsum converts alkaline salts ($Na_2CO_3$) into neutral salts ($Na_2SO_4$), biochar alone may transiently increase pH. However, combined application triggers a buffering mechanism where organic acids from biochar aging neutralize alkalinity. Shen et al. (2024) quantified this, showing that combining acidic furfural residue with gypsum reduced soil alkalinity by an average of 36.7%, significantly outperforming single applications by accelerating the proton-promoted dissolution of calcite. At the colloidal interface, the coupling becomes reciprocal: divalent cations ($Ca^{2+}$) from gypsum compress the diffuse double layer (DDL) to induce flocculation, while recalcitrant carbon acts as a "cementing agent". Xie et al. (2025) utilized spectroscopic analyses (FTIR, XPS) to reveal that nano-biochar promotes the formation of organo-mineral complexes (e.g., Fe-O-C bridges), which are physically more stable against dispersion than mineral aggregates alone. Furthermore, Li et al. (2025) found that organic amendments increased macroaggregates by enhancing the binding of exchangeable $Ca^{2+}$ with organic functional groups, physically protecting SOC from mineralization.
3.2 Bio-Geochemical Coupling: The C-N-P "Lock and Key" Mechanism
Integrated amendments function as a "nutrient pump" that regulates the stoichiometry of C, N, and P, overcoming the nutrient lock-up typical of saline soils. A critical trade-off in remediation is nitrogen loss, yet the porous structure of biochar acts as a "nutrient bank" to mitigate this. Li et al. (2024) provided compelling evidence that co-applying vermicompost with FGD gypsum reduced cumulative ammonia volatilization by 24.8% and decreased nitrate leaching by 27.0%. This "Locking" effect is attributed to the organic matrix stabilizing macroaggregates and shifting the ammonium-ammonia equilibrium. Additionally, Zhao et al. (2025) found that bone-derived biochar combined with humic acid optimized N:P stoichiometry, preventing luxury consumption.
Conversely, the input of labile carbon acts as a "Key" to trigger the "Priming Effect," unlocking native soil nutrients. Bai et al. (2025) utilized metagenomics to reveal that combined amendments significantly upregulated genes encoding alkaline phosphatase (phoA, phoD) and nitrogen fixation (nifH), accelerating nutrient mineralization. Similarly, Zhao et al. (2024) observed that biochar plus wood vinegar increased phosphatase activity by 40.35%. Hemdan & Zou (2024) confirmed that such organo-mineral amendments improved plant uptake by optimizing the hydro-physical environment, effectively creating a "slow-release fertilizer" effect.

3.3 Microbiology of Restoration: From "Halophiles" to "Functional Guilds"
Ultimately, the restoration of saline-alkali soil equates to the restoration of its microbiome. High salinity typically selects for oligotrophic halophiles, but integrated amendments drive a succession towards copiotrophic taxa. Bai et al. (2025) revealed that amendments enriched Proteobacteria involved in nutrient cycling while inhibiting oligotrophs like Chloroflexi. This shift is functional: Xiao et al. (2025) demonstrated via SEM that enhanced enzyme activities and bacterial diversity accounted for 68% of yield variation, while Wang et al. (2024) found that biochar shifted microbial assembly from stochastic to deterministic processes.
Porous amendments further act as "Carriers of Life," sheltering beneficial microbes. Li et al. (2024) successfully constructed a functional microbial agent by immobilizing Bacillus onto biochar carriers; this composite upregulated genes associated with carbon fixation (rbcL) and nitrogen cycling, increasing N and P availability by 1.18 and 2.6 times, respectively. Moreover, integrated amendments reactivate the "Microbial Carbon Pump" (MCP), which is crucial for SOC accumulation. Cheng et al. (2024) provided critical evidence using amino sugar analysis, showing that fungal necromass played a predominant role in long-term SOC sequestration due to its recalcitrant cell walls. Complementing this, Liu et al. (2025) discovered that iron-modified biochar facilitated the interaction between minerals and fungal communities, promoting the formation of stable organic-mineral complexes and actively converting labile carbon into stable soil carbon pools through microbial turnover.

4 Performance Assessment: From Yield to Ecosystem Services
Translating the interfacial mechanisms described previously into tangible restoration outcomes requires a multi-criteria assessment. This section synthesizes evidence from global meta-analyses and long-term field trials to quantify the performance of integrated amendments across three dimensions: physicochemical rehabilitation, agronomic productivity, and carbon sequestration potential.
4.1 Soil Physicochemical Rehabilitation: The Foundation of Recovery
The primary indicator of remediation success is the reversal of saline-alkali constraints, and global datasets indicate that integrated amendments significantly outperform single-factor treatments in this regard. A comprehensive meta-analysis by Li et al. (2025), synthesizing 1425 observations, revealed that organic amendment input (OAI) significantly reduced soil Electrical Conductivity (EC) by 23.6%, pH by 2.3%, and total salt content by 20.9% on average. Regarding sodicity, Huang et al. (2025) quantified that amendments decreased the Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP) by 43.4% across salt-affected soils in China. For industrial by-products specifically, Wang et al. (2021) reported drastic reductions in sodic soils, with FGD gypsum application decreasing ESP by 37.4% and pH by 8.1% across 59 locations, demonstrating the efficacy of calcium-based amendments in displacing sodium ions.
Beyond chemical changes, physical restructuring is critical. Jin et al. (2024) provided rare long-term evidence from a 6-year field trial, showing that biochar application continuously reduced soil bulk density (BD) by 8.09%–8.91% and increased porosity. This physical loosening is corroborated by An et al. (2024), who found that fly ash amendments increased total porosity by 15.6%, effectively breaking the compacted surface crust. Crucially, organic amendments drive the formation of water-stable aggregates. Gao et al. (2024) reported that stabilized sludge products (SSP) increased meso/macro-aggregates (>0.25 mm) by 39.0%–201.3%, thereby unblocking salt discharge channels. Consequently, integrated strategies accelerate the reclamation timeline; Gao et al. (2024) demonstrated that by improving aggregate structure, the $Na^+$ leaching rate increased from 1.1% in untreated soil to 53.3%–79.3% in amended soils. Furthermore, Zhang et al. (2025) found that co-applying superabsorbent carbon-based material and FGD gypsum increased the $Na^+$ leaching concentration by 90.92%, proving that composite amendments can achieve rapid desalination.
4.2 Agronomic Productivity: Closing the Yield Gap
The ultimate goal of restoration is to restore land productivity, and evidence suggests that "waste-derived" amendments can convert barren lands into productive agroecosystems. A global meta-analysis by Li et al. (2025) quantified a mean crop yield increase of 36.5% following organic amendment input. In high-stress environments, Sun et al. (2020) reported a substantial 62.9% yield increase in coastal maize production using a "Biochar + Fulvic Acid" combination, attributed to synergistic stress alleviation. Furthermore, Duan et al. (2025) demonstrated that coupling straw, manure, and chemical fertilizer increased sunflower yield by 49.4% after 8 years of continuous application.
Crop quality is also significantly enhanced through optimized nutrient stoichiometry. Zhu et al. (2025) found that combining subsurface drainage with bio-organic fertilizer not only increased sunflower yield to 2.93 t/ha but also improved seed quality, with oleic acid content reaching 21.73%. Similarly, Li et al. (2025) revealed that co-applying microbial agents and vermicompost improved cotton fiber length and strength by enhancing photosynthetic characteristics. These yield gains translate directly into economic stability. Hemdan & Zou (2024) showed that an optimized regime combining compost (4 tons/fed) and mineral sulfur maximized net profit to 125,517 LE/fed for sorghum production. This economic benefit was driven by improved nutrient use efficiency, demonstrating a "win-win" for restoration and farmer income. Additionally, Zhu et al. (2025) applied a TOPSIS entropy weight model to verify that optimized bio-organic fertilization coupled with drainage provided the best comprehensive benefits.
4.3 Carbon Sequestration Potential: The "Soil Carbon Sink"
Perhaps the most significant contribution of integrated amendments to Cleaner Production is their ability to transform saline-alkali soils from carbon sources into sinks. Saline soils are notoriously carbon-poor, but integrated amendments can rapidly reverse this deficit. Pei et al. (2025) implemented a "Low-carbon strategy" in the Tarim Basin, achieving a 61% increase in Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks over 5 years by combining biochar with reduced nitrogen inputs. More strikingly, Wang et al. (2025) reported that co-applying aluminum sulfate and straw increased SOC content by 231.08% compared to singular applications, demonstrating that inorganic conditioners can catalyze the stabilization of exogenous organic carbon. Wu et al. (2025) verified that combining organic fertilizer with rice husk biochar exhibited the most pronounced "net carbon sink" characteristics.
It is not just about quantity, but stability and chemical protection. Xie et al. (2025) revealed that nano-biochar significantly increased the molecular complexity and aromaticity of SOC, forming stable carbon networks that resist microbial decomposition. Advanced FT-ICR MS characterization by Li et al. (2025) provided molecular-level evidence that "inorganic-organic coupling" protected degradation products, specifically increasing lignin-like compounds and delaying the degradation of plant-derived carbon. Moreover, integrated amendments reactivate the "Microbial Carbon Pump" (MCP); Cheng et al. (2024) provided mechanistic evidence that straw biochar increased the accumulation of fungal-derived glucosamine, contributing to a 17.3% increase in SOC content. This suggests that biochar promotes the formation of recalcitrant microbial necromass (amino sugars), serving as a long-term stable carbon pool. Additionally, Liu et al. (2025) found that Fe-modified biochar facilitated the formation of organic-mineral complexes via fungal-mineral interactions, further reducing the specific carbon mineralization rate.

5. Sustainability Analysis: Balancing Economic Viability with Environmental Trade-offs
While the agronomic efficacy of waste-derived amendments in restoring saline-alkali soils is well-established, their widespread adoption hinges on a rigorous evaluation of holistic sustainability beyond mere yield increments. The transition from linear remediation to a circular economy model requires verifying that these "waste-to-wealth" strategies do not inadvertently transfer pollutants from the industrial sphere to the pedosphere, nor impose prohibitive economic burdens on farmers. Consequently, this section critically assesses the multidimensional feasibility of integrated amendments by synthesizing data from techno-economic analyses and Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) to navigate the complex trade-offs between immediate economic returns and potential environmental risks, while also incorporating Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) to quantify non-market ecological services.
5.1 Economic Feasibility and Ecosystem Service Valuation
The economic viability of soil remediation strategies is the primary determinant for their adoption, particularly in resource-constrained arid regions. While yield increases are a fundamental metric, they do not always translate to profitability due to input price volatility. Therefore, a comprehensive sustainability analysis must navigate the trade-off between input costs and Net Profit. Recent techno-economic analyses emphasize that integrated amendments often yield superior economic returns compared to single-factor treatments. For instance, Hemdan et al. (2024) revealed that while high input rates (e.g., 10 tons/fed compost) maximized biomass, they failed to optimize economic efficiency due to diminishing returns. Instead, an optimized combination (4 tons/fed compost + mineral sulfur) achieved the maximum Net Profit (~125,517 LE/fed), significantly outperforming control groups. This suggests that "Net Profit," rather than yield alone, should serve as the benchmark for determining optimal application rates. To address the bottleneck of high commercial amendment costs, Diao et al. (2025) indicated that utilizing low-dose mineralization additives (derived from industrial by-products) incurred a total material cost of only a fraction of that required for conventional biochar. This substantial cost saving, combined with rapid salinity reduction, highlights the economic superiority of waste-valorized amendments. Beyond direct returns, sustainability must account for non-market ecological values. Luo et al. (2025) introduced the innovative accounting of Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) to quantify the reuse of fish pond sediment (FPS), demonstrating that FPS application not only maximized crop output but also generated a peak GEP of 274,951 CNY ha⁻¹, representing a 185% increase compared to the control. This proves that waste-derived amendments generate ecological dividends exceeding their direct agricultural value.
5.2 Environmental Risk Assessment and Life Cycle Climate Benefits
The transition to a circular economy necessitates quantifying the net climate impact of remediation systems, particularly the trade-off regarding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While organic inputs can transiently increase soil respiration, integrated strategies can mitigate these losses. Li et al. (2025) demonstrated that co-applying vermicompost with FGD gypsum reduced cumulative $NH_3$ volatilization by 24.8% and downregulated denitrification genes (nirK/nirS), thereby lowering emission risks while enhancing nitrogen storage. To rigorously quantify net climate benefits, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) provides a holistic metric beyond field-scale measurements. Deng et al. (2023) performed a cradle-to-grave LCA on herbal medicine residue biochar, revealing a net negative carbon footprint of −395.1 kg $CO_2$-eq per ton, driven primarily by the carbon sequestration value of the biochar itself which offset processing emissions. Similarly, Cappelli et al. (2021) evaluated a gasification-biochar chain and reported a substantial net decrease in climate impact (~−1505 kg $CO_2$-eq/t), attributed largely to fossil energy substitution and stable carbon storage. Validating these LCA findings, Pei et al. (2025) proposed an optimized "Low-carbon strategy" in the Tarim River Basin, establishing that combining biochar with reduced nitrogen fertilization achieved an optimal balance: increasing SOC stocks by 61% while minimizing the footprint of fertilizer inputs. This confirms that integrated amendments satisfy the low-carbon criteria of cleaner production.
5.3 Long-term Ecological Safety and Legacy Effects
While the climatic benefits are evident, the long-term soil security of waste-derived amendments exhibits a sharp divergence based on feedstock origin. The core risk lies in the potential accumulation of heavy metals from industrial and municipal by-products. For industrial sources, large-scale field trials have demonstrated manageable risks under regulated application. Zhao et al. (2018) reported that in a 3-year reclamation project using FGD gypsum, heavy metal concentrations (As, Hg, Cd, Pb) in both reclaimed soil and harvested grains remained well below national food safety standards. Similarly, An et al. (2024) utilized the Hakanson index to evaluate fly ash amendments, reporting ecological risk indices (RI) far below the hazard threshold (RI < 150), suggesting that strictly screened industrial by-products present low risks for short-to-medium-term application. Conversely, the legacy of sewage sludge application presents a more persistent challenge. Although organic amendments generally improve soil fertility, Tai et al. (2016) provided cautionary evidence from a 35-year field study, revealing that Cd and Zn in sludge-amended soils maintained high bioavailability to leafy vegetables despite decades of natural attenuation. This persistence indicates that "time" alone cannot fully mitigate the phytotoxicity risks of municipal wastes, particularly for accumulative elements like Cadmium. Therefore, a differentiated management strategy is required: while gypsum-based systems appear robust, strategies involving sludge or phosphogypsum necessitate stricter source control, such as maintaining application rates below critical thresholds (e.g., <20% for phosphogypsum) to prevent toxic buildup.

6. Context-Specific Implementation Strategies
The heterogeneity of saline-alkali soils globally implies that a "one-size-fits-all" remediation strategy is scientifically invalid. The efficacy of waste-derived amendments is strictly governed by local constraints, primarily the climatic water balance and soil parental material. Therefore, bridging the gap between theoretical mechanisms and practical application requires a scenario-based framework. This section delineates tailored implementation strategies for three dominant problem regions—arid hinterlands, coastal mudflats, and structural sodic soils—demonstrating how integrated amendments can be customized to maximize ecosystem services under diverse environmental boundary conditions.
6.1 Scenario A: Arid & Semi-arid Regions (Water Conservation + Structure)
In arid and semi-arid regions, the primary constraints are acute water scarcity and intense evaporation, which drive capillary rise and secondary salinization. Restoration strategies here must prioritize "Water Holding Capacity (WHC)" to inhibit salt accumulation while maximizing limited irrigation efficiency. Stavi et al. (2021) emphasized that the interaction between groundwater depth and evaporation in drylands is the critical driver of "saline seeps," necessitating remediation measures that not only displace salt but also physically alter soil hydrology to reduce evaporation losses. Building on this, Pei et al. (2025) provided a compelling case study from the Tarim River Basin, where a "Low-carbon strategy" combining biochar (10 t ha⁻¹) with reduced nitrogen fertilizer was superior to high-input regimes. This approach significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) (+61%) and maize yield (+16%) by improving soil pore structure, thereby mitigating the physiological drought caused by salinity without exacerbating regional water scarcity. Furthermore, in calcareous saline soils typical of arid regions (e.g., Egypt), Ali et al. (2024) demonstrated the efficacy of combining sulfur nanoparticles with compost. Their study showed that this organo-mineral combination significantly reduced soil bulk density and hydraulic conductivity. Crucially, the oxidation of nano-sulfur neutralized alkalinity and improved the solubility of $Ca^{2+}$, which synergized with compost to alleviate osmotic stress and enhance nutrient uptake under water-limited conditions. Thus, for arid regions, the amendment strategy must shift from simple "leaching" to "retention and structure optimization" using functionalized waste-derived conditioners.
6.2 Scenario B: Coastal Saline-Sodic Soils (Barrier + Rapid Fertility)
Coastal saline soils face distinct challenges: high groundwater tables, continuous seawater intrusion, and "young" soil genesis with extremely low nutrient pools. The core strategy here necessitates "severing capillary continuity" combined with the rapid construction of a fertile tillage layer. Zhu et al. (2025) proposed a collaborative management model for coastal sunflower cultivation, integrating subsurface drainage with bio-organic fertilizer application. Their study found that narrowing drainage spacing to 10 m, combined with organic amendments, achieved the highest desalination efficiency (reducing salt by ~40%). The organic fertilizer played a dual role: improving soil aggregation to facilitate salt leaching through drainage pipes and rapidly supplementing the nutrient-poor mudflats. Complementing hydraulic engineering, Tang et al. (2025) highlighted the efficacy of physical barriers. Their research on a liquid film combined with a buried straw layer (LFSG) demonstrated that the straw layer acts as a capillary barrier to block upward salt migration, while the surface liquid film suppresses evaporation, significantly improving water use efficiency (WUE) under deficit irrigation. Furthermore, Luo et al. (2024) introduced an innovative "waste-to-wealth" approach in aquaculture zones by repurposing Fish Pond Sediment (FPS). Applying 40–80% FPS to coastal saline soil significantly reduced salinity while drastically increasing organic matter, utilizing the nutrient-rich sediment to support vegetable growth and achieving a high Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP). This highlights a circular model where coastal waste streams are utilized in-situ to restore coastal land resources.
6.3 Scenario C: High-Alkaline/Sodic Soils (Displacement + Acidification)
High-alkaline sodic soils (e.g., Songnen Plain) represent the most recalcitrant category, characterized by high pH (>9.0), high Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP), and soil dispersion. The strategy must prioritize "Chemical Replacement" to flocculate soil particles before organic amendments can function effectively. dos Santos et al. (2021) highlighted that while biochar improves chemical properties, its efficacy in reducing sodicity is significantly amplified when coupled with leaching agents, suggesting the need for amendments that enhance permeability. More specifically for soda saline-alkali soils, Wang et al. (2025) demonstrated that the co-application of aluminum sulfate ($Al^{3+}$) and straw was highly effective. The hydrolysis of $Al^{3+}$ provided essential acidity to neutralize pH and release $Ca^{2+}$, while straw improved the organic carbon pool; this combination increased macroaggregates significantly more than individual applications. Similarly, Nie et al. (2025) confirmed that a composite treatment of gypsum, straw, and sulfuric acid was the most effective strategy for rapid improvement of soda soils. This "Acid + Calcium + Carbon" cocktail reduced pH by 0.53–0.79 units and exchangeable $Na^+$ by up to 74.8%, creating a viable root zone in otherwise inhospitable substrates. This underscores that for structural sodic soils, chemical amendments (gypsum/acids) are a prerequisite to unlock the potential of organic amendments, and integrated "displacement + acidification" strategies are essential for breaking the soil dispersion barrier.

7. Future Perspectives & Challenges
While integrated amendments offer a promising pathway for reconciling waste management with soil security, several scientific and regulatory bottlenecks impede their widespread commercialization. Future research and policy efforts must pivot from empirical trial-and-error to data-driven precision agriculture.
7.1 From Empirical Trials to AI-Driven Precision Remediation
Current formulation strategies largely rely on site-specific field trials, which are time-consuming and lack transferability across heterogeneous landscapes. The future lies in harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to transition from "trial-and-error" to "predictive prescription". Future studies should leverage the growing volume of global meta-analysis datasets to train robust ML algorithms. For instance, Li et al. (2025) successfully utilized Random Forest (RF) models to identify that biochar and manure are superior amendments for boosting crop productivity, quantifying the non-linear contributions of soil pH and EC to yield gaps. Similarly, Mao et al. (2024) employed Aggregated Boosted Tree (ABT) analysis to disentangle the interactions between biochar pyrolysis temperature and soil salinity, revealing that low-temperature biochar (<500 °C) is more effective for reducing ESP. Beyond meta-data, Bandak et al. (2024) demonstrated that advanced algorithms like XGBoost can accurately predict soil salinity variations using remote sensing data, outperforming traditional regression methods, enabling the prediction of precise "Gypsum-to-Biochar" ratios needed to achieve target remediation goals. Moving beyond static predictions, the development of "Digital Twins" for saline aquifers represents the next frontier. Ma et al. (2025) proposed integrating multi-omics data with deep learning to construct digital twin systems that simulate remediation outcomes in silico before field implementation, allowing researchers to virtually test thousands of amendment combinations under various climate scenarios. By combining this computational power with agronomic insights—such as the optimized "Water-Carbon-Salt" regulation strategy proposed by Pei et al. (2025)—researchers can design dynamic remediation protocols that adapt to real-time environmental fluctuations, ensuring long-term sustainability.
7.2 Standardization and "End-of-Waste" Policy Frameworks
The transition from "waste" to "resource" is hindered by the lack of unified quality standards, particularly concerning the potential risks of heavy metals in industrial by-products and biological risks in organic wastes. Policymakers need to establish distinct risk-based "End-of-Waste" criteria for saline-alkali land reclamation, differing from general farmland standards. As noted by Smith (2009), defining clear limits for heavy metals is critical to resolving the conflict between waste recycling and soil protection. Current regulations often rely on total metal concentrations; however, given that elements like Cd and Zn can maintain high bioavailability even after decades, regulatory frameworks must shift to bioavailability-based limits, mandating rigorous long-term monitoring before certifying a waste product. Furthermore, strict source control—such as the "preprocessing" of municipal waste to meet safety standards (e.g., UK PAS100)—is essential to ensure organic wastes are safe agronomic inputs. The economic viability of these amendments often hinges on external financial support; Mohammadi et al. (2020) emphasized that subsidizing the initial capital costs of biochar significantly enhances its Net Present Value (NPV). To operationalize this, Luo et al. (2024) proposed a quantitative Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) accounting model, demonstrating that ecological benefits can far exceed crop revenues. By compensating farmers for the "Soil Carbon Sinks" they create, policymakers can internalize the environmental benefits of waste valorization.
7.3 Expanding the Boundaries of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
While recent studies have quantified the carbon footprint of biochar production, most assessments remain restricted to "Cradle-to-Gate". To accurately evaluate sustainability, future assessments must shift towards a holistic "Cradle-to-Grave" perspective that includes the long-term fate of amendments in the pedosphere. Marzeddu et al. (2021) demonstrated that including the soil application phase accounts for significant carbon sequestration benefits (net decrease of ~10e3 kg $CO_2$ eq). Crucially, this must capture the "priming effect" on native soil carbon and integrate the suppression of $N_2O$ emissions over decades to avoid underestimating climate mitigation potential. Furthermore, Jeswani et al. (2022) emphasized the need for dynamic LCA models that account for the timing of carbon storage reversibility rather than static metrics. Beyond environmental metrics, Social LCA (S-LCA) indicators should be incorporated to evaluate farmer adoption willingness and consumer perceptions regarding the use of "waste" in food production. To operationalize this, Zhu et al. (2025) successfully applied the TOPSIS entropy weight method, integrating nine diverse indicators—including yield, quality, and emission reduction—into a comprehensive scoring system. This multi-criteria approach provides a robust framework for policymakers to identify "waste-to-wealth" scenarios that are socially equitable and economically viable.
