We observed a marked increase in | 0.18
Unexpectedly, the treatment resulted in | 0.14
In our field experiment | 0.12
At the plot scale | 0.10
Under saline field conditions | 0.11
Contrary to our initial hypothesis | 0.09
One plausible explanation is that | 0.16
This discrepancy likely arises from | 0.15
A closer inspection of the data reveals | 0.14
When examined separately | 0.13
Notably, this effect was absent in | 0.08
We therefore argue that | 0.17
It remains unclear whether | 0.12
From a mechanistic standpoint | 0.13
Taken together with prior evidence | 0.16
In long-term field trials | 0.10
Across multiple growing seasons | 0.11
At low application rates | 0.09
This pattern was not consistently observed | 0.12
We cautiously interpret these results as | 0.15
A possible confounding factor is | 0.14
Our measurements indicate substantial variability in | 0.13
This response differed markedly between sites | 0.11
Under real-world agronomic conditions | 0.10
This interpretation aligns partially with | 0.14
An alternative explanation could be | 0.15
Field observations further suggest that | 0.16
This trend weakened over time | 0.12
The magnitude of this effect depended on | 0.13
